Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n

The\\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\\n\\n  Terminology\\n  -----------\\n\\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\\n\\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\\n\\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\\n\\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\\n  itself fulfill.\\n\\n\\n  Basic Usage:\\n  ------------\\n\\n  ```js\\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    // on success\\n    resolve(value);\\n\\n    // on failure\\n    reject(reason);\\n  });\\n\\n  promise.then(function(value) {\\n    // on fulfillment\\n  }, function(reason) {\\n    // on rejection\\n  });\\n  ```\\n\\n  Advanced Usage:\\n  ---------------\\n\\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\\n\\n  ```js\\n  function getJSON(url) {\\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\\n\\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\\n      xhr.send();\\n\\n      function handler() {\\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\\n          if (this.status === 200) {\\n            resolve(this.response);\\n          } else {\\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\\n          }\\n        }\\n      };\\n    });\\n  }\\n\\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\\n    // on fulfillment\\n  }, function(reason) {\\n    // on rejection\\n  });\\n  ```\\n\\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\\n\\n  ```js\\n  Promise.all([\\n    getJSON('/posts'),\\n    getJSON('/comments')\\n  ]).then(function(values){\\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\\n\\n    return values;\\n  });\\n  ```\\n\\n  @class Promise\\n  @param {Function} resolver\\n  Useful for tooling.\\n  @constructor\\n*/\\n\\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\\n  function Promise(resolver) {\\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\\n    this._subscribers = [];\\n\\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\\n   ```js\\n  findUser().then(function(user){\\n    // user is available\\n  }, function(reason){\\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\\n  });\\n  ```\\n   Chaining\\n  --------\\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\\n   ```js\\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\\n    return user.name;\\n  }, function (reason) {\\n    return 'default name';\\n  }).then(function (userName) {\\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\\n    // will be `'default name'`\\n  });\\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\\n  }, function (reason) {\\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\\n  }).then(function (value) {\\n    // never reached\\n  }, function (reason) {\\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\\n  });\\n  ```\\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\\n   ```js\\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\\n  }).then(function (value) {\\n    // never reached\\n  }).then(function (value) {\\n    // never reached\\n  }, function (reason) {\\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\\n  });\\n  ```\\n   Assimilation\\n  ------------\\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\\n   ```js\\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\\n  }).then(function (comments) {\\n    // The user's comments are now available\\n  });\\n  ```\\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\\n   ```js\\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\\n  }).then(function (comments) {\\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\\n  }, function (reason) {\\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\\n  });\\n  ```\\n   Simple Example\\n  --------------\\n   Synchronous Example\\n   ```javascript\\n  let result;\\n   try {\\n    result = findResult();\\n    // success\\n  } catch(reason) {\\n    // failure\\n  }\\n  ```\\n   Errback Example\\n   ```js\\n  findResult(function(result, err){\\n    if (err) {\\n      // failure\\n    } else {\\n      // success\\n    }\\n  });\\n  ```\\n   Promise Example;\\n   ```javascript\\n  findResult().then(function(result){\\n    // success\\n  }, function(reason){\\n    // failure\\n  });\\n  ```\\n   Advanced Example\\n  --------------\\n   Synchronous Example\\n   ```javascript\\n  let author, books;\\n   try {\\n    author = findAuthor();\\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\\n    // success\\n  } catch(reason) {\\n    // failure\\n  }\\n  ```\\n   Errback Example\\n   ```js\\n   function foundBooks(books) {\\n   }\\n   function failure(reason) {\\n   }\\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\\n    if (err) {\\n      failure(err);\\n      // failure\\n    } else {\\n      try {\\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\\n          if (err) {\\n            failure(err);\\n          } else {\\n            try {\\n              foundBooks(books);\\n            } catch(reason) {\\n              failure(reason);\\n            }\\n          }\\n        });\\n      } catch(error) {\\n        failure(err);\\n      }\\n      // success\\n    }\\n  });\\n  ```\\n   Promise Example;\\n   ```javascript\\n  findAuthor().\\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\\n    then(function(books){\\n      // found books\\n  }).catch(function(reason){\\n    // something went wrong\\n  });\\n  ```\\n   @method then\\n  @param {Function} onFulfilled\\n  @param {Function} onRejected\\n  Useful for tooling.\\n  @return {Promise}\\n  */\\n\\n  /**\\n  `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\\n  as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\\n  ```js\\n  function findAuthor(){\\n  throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\\n  }\\n  // synchronous\\n  try {\\n  findAuthor();\\n  } catch(reason) {\\n  // something went wrong\\n  }\\n  // async with promises\\n  findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\\n  // something went wrong\\n  });\\n  ```\\n  @method catch\\n  @param {Function} onRejection\\n  Useful for tooling.\\n  @return {Promise}\\n  */\\n\\n\\n  Promise.prototype.catch = function _catch(onRejection) {\\n    return this.then(null, onRejection);\\n  };\\n\\n  /**\\n    `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\\n    try/catch/finally behaves\\n  \\n    Synchronous example:\\n  \\n    ```js\\n    findAuthor() {\\n      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\\n        throw new Error();\\n      }\\n      return new Author();\\n    }\\n  \\n    try {\\n      return findAuthor();
